When we were working with univariate random variables, the sets of interest were usually intervals (i.e. what's the probability that $z$ is between $a$ and $b$?).

Stop and verify both of these facts. We need both conditions to hold, so the set of $\\omega$s that place $z$ into the region of interest is $Z^{-1}(A) = [0.5, \\sqrt{0.5}] \\approx [0.5, 0.707]$.

Think of it as looking down from above onto the stacks of outcomes that are piled up on the labels for the values that they are destined to become. In this case, the darker squares are the piles that are sticking up towards you more. For instance, the square that corresponds to $v_1=6$, $v_2=4$ is a darkish blue because about 3% of all the outcomes in $\\Omega$ (whatever it is) get mapped to that combination of values. The square that corresponds to $v_1=9$, $v_2=9$ is a a pale yellow because about 0% of all the outcomes in $\\Omega$ get mapped to that combination of values. "

    "The marginal distribution of $\\mathbf Z_2$ is what you get when you consider the factory $[\\mathbf Z_1, \\mathbf Z_2]$, but completely ignore the outputs $z_1$ and only look at the $z_2$s. You haven't changed the silo $\\Omega$ at all (unlike conditioning). Thinking about it in terms of density plots, the 2D *joint* density plot is what you get when you stack up all of the outcomes on top of the labels of the points $(z_1, z_2)$ that they map to. The *marginal* density plot is what you get when you combine all of the stacks of outcomes that have the same $z_2$ label. "

For example, what if we wanted to know the outright probability that someone is between 1.9 and 2.3 meters tall, regardless of their weight? If we start out with the joint distribution of height and weight, first we have to find the marginal distribution of height (by integrating out the weight variable), then integrate the resulting distribution between 1.9 and 2.3 to get the final answer."

    "Multivariate random variables are groups of single random variables and their distribution together is called a joint distribution. The joint can be integrated/summed to yield the probability that a set of conditions on all the variables is simultaneously satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint distribution can also be used to calculate conditional probabilities, which are the probabilities that one or more random variables satisfy a condition, given that other random variables satisfy some other conditon. We used our intuition about the sample space to realize that conditional probabilities are just ratios of volumes of subsets of the sample space. Thus we can calculate conditional probabilities by taking the ratio of two integrals or sums of the joint density or mass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took the idea further to define conditioned random variables, which are random variables that operate on a subset of the original sample space that's defined by a condition on other random variables. The conditional distribution is easy to extract from the joint: just hardcode the value of the conditioning variables in the joint distribution, and divide by a scaling factor so that the conditioned distribution still integrates/sums to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the scaling factor, when viewed as a function of the hardcoded value, is itself a probability distribution that we call the marginal. That allows us to write any joint distribution as a product of a conditional distribution and a marginal distribution. Bayes theorem uses that relation to equate different products of conditional and marginal distribution via the joint distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that there are joint distributions where conditioning on some variables gives you the same result as marginalizing them out. When this is the case, we say that the variables that are marginalized out are independent from those that you have the marginal of. Independence lets us factor the joint distribution into a product of marginals. Independence means that information about one variable (or set of variables) doesn't tell you anything about another (or another set). A similar factorization holds if the variables are only conditionally independent, which means that information about one variable (or set) doesn't tell you anything about another above and beyond what the conditioning variable or variables tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we saw that random variables can be transformed algebraically to yield new random variables. The key to figuring out how the distributions are related is to know how to find the pre-image of sets under the transformation. We also saw that transformations can be marginalized over, conditoned on, etc. just the same as other random variables."
