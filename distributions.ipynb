So, for example, if $z$ were some measurement we made on all patients, $z_i$ would be the value of that measurement for the $i$th patient. The patient in our example is what we call the *unit of observation*. But if we were talking about classifying pictures as having cats or not having cats in them, the unit of observation would be the picture. So, in general, the subscript $i$ refers to the $i$th observation in the dataset, which could be a patient, a photograph, a credit card transaction, etc. \n",

So, in our example, we'll say $x_{i1}$ is patient $i$'s pre-treatment blood pressure, $x_{i2}$ is their pre-treatment heart rate, etc. We will use $p$ to refer to the number of predictors we have for each observation, so $j \\in \\{1 \\dots p\\}$.

Taking a drug influences the levels of certain chemicals in the blood, which are taken up at particular rates in certain organs by certain enzymes, the levels of which are impacted by the patient's genetics and prior physiological state, which was influenced by their life history, etc. Thus the impact of the drug on cellular processes is mediated by these factors.
