So, for example, if $z$ were some measurement we made on all patients, $z_i$ would be the value of that measurement for the $i$th patient. The patient in our example is what we call the *unit of observation*. But if we were talking about classifying pictures as having cats or not having cats in them, the unit of observation would be the picture. So, in general, the subscript $i$ refers to the $i$th observation in the dataset, which could be a patient, a photograph, a credit card transaction, etc. \n",

So, in our example, we'll say $x_{i1}$ is patient $i$'s pre-treatment blood pressure, $x_{i2}$ is their pre-treatment heart rate, etc. We will use $p$ to refer to the number of predictors we have for each observation, so $j \\in \\{1 \\dots p\\}$.

As we go on I'm going to introduce more mathematical notation as we need it, and I'm going to wean off the factory metaphor, but I encourage you to keep building your intuition about these concepts instead of thinking about them as abstract symbols on a page.

Ok, next up is [set-builder notation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/set-builder-notation.html): you can read $\\{a\\in A | f(a) = 1\\}$ as \"the collection of all the elements $a$ in the set $A$ *such that* $f(a)=1$\". So $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf Z(w)=z\\}$ is the set of outcomes $\\omega$ that become $z$ when passed through the random variable $\\mathbf Z$. Finally, we have $P()$, which is the [probability measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure). We won't define this super rigorously, but it is basically defined as the measurement of the proportion of all of the outcomes in $\\Omega$ that are contained in the subset $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf Z(w)=z\\}$.

It's the middle part of a Venn diagram. $A \\cup B$ is read  as \"the union of $A$ and $B$\", which is all of the elements in either set- that's the entirety of the Venn diagram.

If we're imagining a the factory that might produce the data we observe when flipping a coin, a binary output is all we need. Similarly, if we want to imagine the factory that assigns an \"apple\", \"orange\", or \"banana\" label to a photograph of a fruit, it just needs to output a discrete set of three values. But if we want to imagine the kind of factory that could produce the prices of different appartments in New York, we need something that can output a continuous range of values."

Well, an infinite number: for any two numbers in that interval, you can find a number that's right between them. Since one nugget from the silo always makes the same value when pushed through the factory, there need to be an infinite number of nuggets in the silo to be able to produce an infinite number of values. That means our old code, where we manually enumerated all of the values in $\\Omega$, is not going to work anymore. What we can do instead is imagine that $\\Omega$ is itself an interval, like all the numbers between 0 and 1. So, to pick a random nugget to throw into the factory, we just pick a random number between 0 and 1. Here's an example:"

    "So $\\mathbf Z$ is defined by $\\mathbf Z(\\omega) = 10\\omega^2$ with $\\omega \\in [0,1]$. Great. But now what does $P(\\mathbf Z = z)$ mean? We just apply the same old definition of probability: it's the proportion of nuggets in the silo that are destined to become the value $z$. For the random variable $\\bf z$ we've defined above, how many nuggets become the value $2.5$? $\\mathbf Z$ transforms outcomes $\\omega$ into realizations $z$ by applying the function $z=10\\omega^2$, so the answer is just one: $\\omega = \\sqrt{2.5/10} = 0.5$. Thus to know $P(\\mathbf Z = 0.75)$ what we need to know is how much \"volume\" a single point ($\\omega = 0.5$) takes up within the interval $[0,1]$. The answer, which may not surprise you, is 0. If you want a rigorous argument for why that's the case, you have to pick up a real analysis or measure theory textbook. The implication is that for any (strictly) continuously-valued random variable, the probability of it taking any given value in particular is zero: $P(\\mathbf Z = z) = 0$, no matter what $z$ is. "

Again looking at the transformation $z = 10\\omega^2$, you can see that only values of $\\omega$ between $0.5$ and $0.3$ produce values between $2.5$ and $9$. The proportion of volume that the interval $[0.3, 0.5]$ takes up within the interval $[0,1]$ is is the length of the interval $[0.3, 0.5]$ (which is $0.2$) as a proportion of the length of the interval $[0,1]$ (which is 1).

    "More buckets gives us more information. If we want to know $P(\\mathbf Z \\in [0,0.5))$, for instance, we can sum up the probabilities for the buckets $[0,0.1)$, $[0.1,0.2)$, ... $[0.4,0.5)$. But we can't get *any* probability. The graph doesn't have enough information to let us calculate probabilities over intervals whose ends are between two cutpoints of the buckets. It only has resolution up to increments of $0.1$ in terms of $z$. It would be nice to have a graph that lets us read off arbitrary probabilities like $P(\\mathbf Z \\in [a,b])$ just by looking at how much \"stuff\" there is between $a$ and $b$.

    "There are [hundreds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg) of well-studied distributions available to choose from when modeling. The most important thing to know about a distribution is what values random variables that are so-distributed can produce. This is sometimes called the *support* of the distribution. For instance, varaibles that are normally-, Cauchy-, or Laplace-distributed can take values between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$. The $\\chi^2$ distribution has support on $[0,\\infty)$. The beta and standard uniform distributions have support on $[0,1]$. The Poisson distribution has support on the counting numbers 0, 1, 2..., and the K-categorical distribution has support on a finite number of integers 0, 1, 2, ... K. \n",

    "\n",
    "The point of this diversity is that it is possible to model different kinds of data. Apartment rents are always positive numbers, but theoretically unbounded above (a scary thought), so perhaps $\\chi^2$ is a good choice. The number of cars that pass through an intersection in a given day is always an integer, so Poisson is a reasonable choice for that. You don't have to remember any of these specific distributions or examples- just know there are many preconstructed pretend data factories out there to play with. Also know that the real data factory is pretty much *never* actually one of these distributions, although, sometimes, it might be well-approximated by one."
