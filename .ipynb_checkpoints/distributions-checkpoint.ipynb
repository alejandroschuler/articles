So, for example, if $z$ were some measurement we made on all patients, $z_i$ would be the value of that measurement for the $i$th patient. The patient in our example is what we call the *unit of observation*. But if we were talking about classifying pictures as having cats or not having cats in them, the unit of observation would be the picture. So, in general, the subscript $i$ refers to the $i$th observation in the dataset, which could be a patient, a photograph, a credit card transaction, etc. \n",

So, in our example, we'll say $x_{i1}$ is patient $i$'s pre-treatment blood pressure, $x_{i2}$ is their pre-treatment heart rate, etc. We will use $p$ to refer to the number of predictors we have for each observation, so $j \\in \\{1 \\dots p\\}$.

Sure, I've concocted a somewhat elaborate metaphor, but it's a metaphor that accurately describes how these otherwise very abstract concepts relate to each other. If you can look at something like $P(\\mathbf z = z) := P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\})$ and immediately come away with an understanding of what that means, all the more power to you. But I don't. At least not without first building up an intuition for each of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I talk about these things outside of the context of explaining them, I do call them by their real names (e.g. random variable, sample space, etc.) because that's what people have called them for nearly a century. But when I close my eyes and *reason* about these concepts, I'm thinking about something tangible, like a factory. As we go on I'm going to introduce more mathematical notation as we need it, and I'm going to wean off the factory metaphor, but I encourage you to keep building your intuition about these concepts instead of thinking about them as abstract symbols on a page. The symbols are just a convenient shorthand for the ideas. The only reason to know the standard names and symbols is to be able to read and understand what others have written. If you find yourself skimming over an equation- stop. Read it slowly and think about what each part means.\n",

    "$$P(\\mathbf z = z) := P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\})$$\n",

    "To start, the $:=$ means \"the thing on the left is defined as the thing on the right\". So we're saying that when we write \"$P(\\mathbf z = z)$\", we really mean whatever \"$P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\})$\" is. Ok, next up is [set-builder notation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/set-builder-notation.html): you can read $\\{a\\in A | f(a) = 1\\}$ as \"the collection of all the elements $a$ in the set $A$ *such that* $f(a)=1$\". So $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\}$ is the set of outcomes $\\omega$ that become $z$ when passed through the random variable $\\mathbf z$. Finally, we have $P()$, which is the [probability measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure). We won't define this super rigorously, but it is basically defined as the measurement of the proportion of all of the outcomes in $\\Omega$ that are contained in the subset $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\}$. If you put all of that together, you'll see that it's exactly the same as the definition we put together using our factory anaology.\n",

    "When we say \"the proportion of all outcomes in $\\Omega$ that are in a subset $A$\", what we mean is that we're literally going to measure the volume of space that the nuggets in $A$ take up in the silo $\\Omega$. By convention, we say that $\\Omega$ has volume 1 so that the volume of $A$ is also the proportion of $A$ in $\\Omega$. "

    "To start with, let's \"derive\" a relatively simple fact: for a subset $F \\subset \\Omega$, $P(F) \\in [0,1]$. This is a compact way of writing that for any subset of outcomes, the proportion of outcomes in that subset relative to how many are in the whole sample space is a number between 0 and 1 ($A \\subset B$ means that $A$ is a subset of $B$). At this point, that should be obvious to you. If the volume of our silo $\\Omega$ is 1, the volume of any subset of that has to be less than 1."

    "Here's a trickier one: for $A,B \\subset \\Omega$, if $A \\cap B = 0$, then $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$. This one has more symbols, but it's also really obvious when you know what they mean. $A \\cap B$ is read as \"the intersection of the sets $A$ and $B$\", which is the set of elements that are in both sets. It's the middle part of a Venn diagram. $A \\cup B$ is read  as \"the union of $A$ and $B$\", which is all of the elements in either set- that's the entirety of the Venn diagram. So what we're saying here is that if A and B don't share any outcomes between them, the probability of the union of the two is the same as the sum of the probabilities of each of them. \n",

    "That also seems cryptic until you think about it in terms of quantities of ore nuggets that produce certain values when fed through the factory. If you take all the ore nuggets that end up becoming the value $a$ (call that set of nuggets $A$), and all the nuggets that end up becoming the value $b$ (call that $B$), then the total volume that end up becoming either $a$ or $b$ (that's $P(A \\cup B)$) is the sum of the volumes that become $a$ (that's $P(A)$) and those that become $b$ (that's $P(B)$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this only holds for sets $A$ and $B$ that don't overlap ($A\\cap B = 0$). For instance, if $A= \\{\\omega \\vert \\mathbf z(\\omega) \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}$ (all the outcomes that map to either 0 or 1) and $B = \\{\\omega \\vert \\mathbf z(\\omega) = 0\\}$ (all the outcomes that map to 0), every element of $B$ is also an element of $A$, so the volume of the union $A \\cup B$ is the volume of $A$, which is not the volume of $A$ plus the volume of $B$."
