So, for example, if $z$ were some measurement we made on all patients, $z_i$ would be the value of that measurement for the $i$th patient. The patient in our example is what we call the *unit of observation*. But if we were talking about classifying pictures as having cats or not having cats in them, the unit of observation would be the picture. So, in general, the subscript $i$ refers to the $i$th observation in the dataset, which could be a patient, a photograph, a credit card transaction, etc. \n",

So, in our example, we'll say $x_{i1}$ is patient $i$'s pre-treatment blood pressure, $x_{i2}$ is their pre-treatment heart rate, etc. We will use $p$ to refer to the number of predictors we have for each observation, so $j \\in \\{1 \\dots p\\}$.

As we go on I'm going to introduce more mathematical notation as we need it, and I'm going to wean off the factory metaphor, but I encourage you to keep building your intuition about these concepts instead of thinking about them as abstract symbols on a page. The symbols are just a convenient shorthand for the ideas. The only reason to know the standard names and symbols is to be able to read and understand what others have written. If you find yourself skimming over an equation- stop. Read it slowly and think about what each part means.\n",

Ok, next up is [set-builder notation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/set-builder-notation.html): you can read $\\{a\\in A | f(a) = 1\\}$ as \"the collection of all the elements $a$ in the set $A$ *such that* $f(a)=1$\". So $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\}$ is the set of outcomes $\\omega$ that become $z$ when passed through the random variable $\\mathbf z$. Finally, we have $P()$, which is the [probability measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure). We won't define this super rigorously, but it is basically defined as the measurement of the proportion of all of the outcomes in $\\Omega$ that are contained in the subset $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega \\vert \\mathbf z(w)=z\\}$.

It's the middle part of a Venn diagram. $A \\cup B$ is read  as \"the union of $A$ and $B$\", which is all of the elements in either set- that's the entirety of the Venn diagram.

If we're imagining a the factory that might produce the data we observe when flipping a coin, a binary output is all we need. Similarly, if we want to imagine the factory that assigns an \"apple\", \"orange\", or \"banana\" label to a photograph, it just needs to output a discrete set of three values. But if we want to imagine the kind of factory that could produce the prices of different appartments in New York, we need something that can output a continuous range of values."
